# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM  

This project builds a stock price prediction model using an LSTM neural network. The model is trained on historical stock data and can predict future prices based on input sequences.  

## Features  
- LSTM-based model for time series forecasting  
- **Preprocessing with MinMaxScaler** for better accuracy  
- **Model & Scaler saved using TensorFlow & Joblib**  

##  Tech Stack  
- Python, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn  
- Pandas, NumPy, Joblib  

## Setup Instructions  

### Install Dependencies  
bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas scikit-learn joblib
